✅ **Task Completed: PRODIGY_CS_Task01**  
🔐 **Caesar Cipher – Encryption & Decryption in Python**

I’ve successfully completed the first task in my Cybersecurity Internship at [Prodigy Infotech](https://prodigyinfotech.dev/).

This task helped me understand how Caesar Cipher works — a classic encryption technique in cryptography.
